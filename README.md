# Introduction

`create-shadowizard-app` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to quickly create a new project with preconfigured styles using the Shadowizard library. Shadowizard is a CSS library that provides easy-to-use classes to add box shadows to elements in your web page.

# Installation
To use create-shadowizard-app, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can install create-shadowizard-app globally by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g create-shadowizard-app
```
# Usage

To create a new project with `create-shadowizard-app`, you can run the following command in your terminal:
```
create-shadowizard-app my-app
```

This will create a new directory named my-app in your current working directory, and install all the necessary dependencies to get started with a new project using Shadowizard.

You can then navigate to the my-app directory and start the development server by running the following commands:``
```
cd my-app
npm start
```
This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000/`, where you can see your app in action.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

`npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!

Removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

# Conclusion

`create-shadowizard-app` provides an easy and quick way to get started with a new project using the Shadowizard library. With the preconfigured styles, you can focus on building your app without worrying about the CSS.
